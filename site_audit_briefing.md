# Technical Briefing: 48-Hour Site Load Audit

**Objective:** To capture real-time power consumption data to ensure the Solar Mini-Grid is accurately sized for peak demand and future growth.

---

## 1. Why is this Audit Critical?
*   **Precision Engineering:** Prevents "over-sizing" (which wastes capital) or "under-sizing" (which leads to system failure).
*   **Financial Bankability:** Provides the data needed for institutional lenders (DFIs) to verify the project's ROI.
*   **Savings Validation:** Confirms exactly how much diesel the solar system will displace.

## 2. The Process
1.  **Installation (Day 0):** Our technical team installs industrial-grade data loggers at the main distribution boards.
2.  **Continuous Logging (48-72 Hours):** The device records voltage, current, power factor, and harmonic distortion every 5 minutes.
3.  **Data Analysis:** We identify peak surge times (e.g., when heavy machinery or air conditioners start) and base loads.
4.  **Final Design Report:** We present a finalized system capacity (kWp/kWh) based on *actual* usage rather than estimates.

## 3. Requirements from Client
*   **Access:** Unhindered access to the main electrical panel/power house.
*   **Normal Operations:** The facility/community should operate normally during the audit to ensure data is representative.
*   **Safety Liaison:** A designated site electrician to assist with panel access.
